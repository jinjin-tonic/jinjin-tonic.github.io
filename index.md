#### Hi ðŸ‘‹ !
I am Haejin Cho (ì¡°í•´ì§„), or just Jin, and thanks for visiting my personal blog!



#### A brief history of me
I was born in Masan, a small city near the sea in Korea, in a Korea-Vietnam mixed family. I was a girl who loves imagination, playing piano, playing games, and reading novels. I also dreamed about living in a BIG city like Seoul or Tokyo. I miss my home village now, but I still like big cities ðŸ˜†

After finishing high school, I moved to Seoul to study Korean language and literature at Yonsei University. During this time, I wasn't sure I really wanted to study my major ðŸ¤” So, I tried *a lot of* different things to look for what I really wanted to do: Japanese literature, linguistics, *computer science*, law, information studies, making bubble tea ðŸ§‹, travel, etc.

Without knowing what I really wanted to do, I moved to Canada to find things that I love and try new things in a new environment. While learning English and French in Montreal, I started studying math and CS, which made me excited! I thought it would be cool to combine CS and my background, linguistics. So, I applied to UBC, accepted, and am very enjoying my study right now!

I am looking forward to see what is going to happen next in my life; what I am going to learn and challenge, and also, where I am going to live ðŸ˜‰
