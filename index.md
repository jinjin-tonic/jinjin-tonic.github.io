#### Hi ðŸ‘‹ !
I am Haejin Cho (ì¡°í•´ì§„), or just Jin, and thanks for visiting my personal blog!

#### A brief (TMI) history of me
I was born in Masan, a small city near the sea in Korea, in a Korea-Vietnam mixed family. I was a girl who loved imagination, playing piano, playing games, and reading novels. I also dreamed about living in a BIG city like Seoul or Tokyo. I miss my home town now, but I still like big cities ðŸ˜†.

After finishing high school, I moved to Seoul to study Korean Language and Literature at Yonsei University. During this time, I wasn't sure I really wanted to pursue my major ðŸ¤”. So, I tried *a lot of* different things to look for what I really wanted to do: Japanese literature, linguistics, *computer science*, law, information studies, making bubble tea ðŸ§‹, traveling, etc.

Without knowing what I really wanted to do, I moved to Canada to discover new interests and try different things in an unfamiliar environment. I started learning English and French in Montreal, and also, I started studying math and CS, which was really exciting to me! I thought it would be cool to combine CS and my background (linguistics), so, I applied to UBC, was accepted, and am now really enjoying my day to day studying!

I am looking forward to seeing what will happen next in my life; what I am going to learn and challenge, and also, where I am going to live ðŸ˜‰
