#### Hi ðŸ‘‹ !

- I am Haejin Cho (ì¡°í•´ì§„), or just Jin, and thanks for visiting my personal blog!

#### A brief history of me

- I was born in Masan, a small city near the sea in Korea, in a Korea-Vietnam mixed family.
  - I was a girl who loves imagination, playing piano, playing games, and reading novels.
  - I also dreamed about living in a BIG city like Seoul or Tokyo. I miss my home village now, but I still like big cities ðŸ˜†
- After finishing high school, I moved to Seoul to study Korean language and literature at Yonsei University.
  - During this time, I wasn't sure I really wanted to study my major ðŸ¤”
  - So I tried *a lot of* different things to look for what I really wanted to do: Japanese literature, linguistics, *computer science*, law, information studies, making bubble tea ðŸ§‹, travel, etc.
- Without knowing what I really wanted to do, I moved to Canada to find things that I love and try new things in a new environment.
  - Learning English and French in Montreal, I started studying math and CS, which made me excited! I thought it would be cool to combine CS and my background, linguistics.
  - So, I applied to UBC, accepted, and am very enjoying my study right now!
- I am looking forward to see what is going to happen in my life next, like what I am going to learn and challenge, and also, where I am going to live ðŸ˜‰
